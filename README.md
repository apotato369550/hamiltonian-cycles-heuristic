# Anchored Cycles

A simple Python-based simulation framework for experimenting with heuristic algorithms to find Hamiltonian cycles in complete, weighted graphs.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This project explores a family of anchor-based heuristics â€” starting from a simple idea: choose the two lowest-weight edges from a vertex to seed a cycle. The goal is to compare these heuristics against standard greedy and other algorithms to find efficient Hamiltonian cycles.


## âœ… Features (Planned)

- Random graph generation
- Heuristic comparison (greedy, anchor-based, maybe Dijkstra hybrid)
- Performance timing and logging
- Output results to `.json` or `.txt` for visualization

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is an early stage prototype meant for experimentation and learning.

## ðŸ“š Background

Initial concept created on May 2, 2025 during a Discrete Math II class. This repository documents the development and testing of those ideas.
