## Quick Reference

### Running Tests
```bash
python src/tests/test_graph_generators.py
```
Expected: All 34 tests pass in ~0.1 seconds

### Running Demo
```bash
python src/main.py
```
Shows 5 comprehensive demonstrations of all generators

### Checking Specific Property
```python
from graph_generation.verification import GraphVerifier

verifier = GraphVerifier(fast_mode=False)
result = verifier.verify_metricity(matrix)
print(f"Metricity Score: {result.details['metricity_score']}")
```

## Critical Principles (Remember These!)

1. **Euclidean Property:** Scale COORDINATES, not weights
2. **Quasi-Metrics:** Only check forward-path constraints, not all permutations
3. **MST vs Completion:** Choose strategy based on desired weight distribution

See CLAUDE.md for detailed explanations.
